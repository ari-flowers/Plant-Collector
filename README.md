# Plant-Collector
Welcome to the Plant Collector!
A plant tracking and management app.

A user will be able to sign up for an account and log in, gaining access to additional functionality.

As a user, I will be able to log in and:

-Create new plant entries unique to my account that include name, species, description, and age  
-Edit existing plant entries
-Delete existing plant entries

-Add watering entries that specify when the plant was watered, and whether it was a top or bottom watering.

-Create items that will be added to an inventory that can later be equipped to a plant's card.
  -Items will disappear from the inventory if added to a plant, and reappear when deleted from a plant.

-Upload photos of my plant and its growth periodically.
